# Wine Quality Prediction (End-to-End)

This project leverages advanced machine learning to predict wine quality based on chemical properties. It includes thorough data preprocessing, detailed analysis, and robust model deployment, all tracked and optimized with MLflow.

### Features: 

1. Feature Engineering
2. Interactive Visuals
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Cross-Validation
5. Model Deployment
6. MLflow Tracking
7. API Endpoints

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Workflow

1. update config.yaml
2. update schema.yaml
3. update params.yaml
4. update the entity 
5. update the configuration manager in src config
6. update the components
7. update the pipeline
8. update the main.py
9. update the app.py
